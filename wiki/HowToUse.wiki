The url bar can be used to navigate to home, type urls, stop page loading, etc.

The tool bar provide easy access to previous/next navigation buttons, open/close tabs and bookmarks.

Notes:
 * The bars hide automatically after a few time. This time can be changed through _Preferences_. If a page is loading, bars will hide after the page has loaded;
 * Touching the screen will hide the bars;
 * The _Bookmarks_ button in the tool bar can be changed to _History_ through _Preferences_;

= Switching tabs =

Switching between tabs is made by sweeping horizontally on the screen.

= Zooming =

Zooming in and out is made by the volume keys.
